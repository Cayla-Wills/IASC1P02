<h1>Mothman: The Man, The Myth, The Moth</h1>
<h3><a href="https://cayla-wills.github.io/IASC1P02/Lab%202/Challenge2Site1.html">A Brief Overview of Mothman</a></h3>
<p>The story and lore surrounding the Mothman is an excellent example of modern American folklore. Getting its start in the late 1960s in Point Plesant West Virginia, Mothman has captivated audiences around the world with its unique stories, sightings, and suspicious origin. While many people have their speculations about the creature, most fall into one of three camps when talking about the reason this creature exists. These camps are:</p>

<p>Most surprisingly, the Mothman actually has no real connections to actual moths. Its original description likens it more to a "large flying man with 10-foot wings", or a "large grey creature". The only mention in the description that is vaguely moth-like is the red eyes, as some insects (like spiders and moths) have light reflecting eyes that could, under the right conditions, look like they are glowing red. Most scientist compare the mothman's wings to that of a sandhill crane, or other crane like birds, saying that what the two young couples saw that night at the WWII munitions plant was actually a migratory sandhill crane and not a creature beyond what we reason to be normal. Use the link below to compare the differences in images of moth and crane wings to understand the debate between the parapsychologists on the side of more supernatural phenomena, and the biologists/skeptics on the side of tangible science. <a href="mypage.html">Click Here for Moth v Crane Comparisons</a></p>
<p>Mothman seems to be, according to most of the lore surrounding it, a benevolent creature that has become a staple in modern American folklore, and its reach is outstanding for such a small and quiet town in the 1960s. Like the other American cryptids, it draws in a crowd of fervent believers, casual enjoyers, and nicer non-believers/skeptics who just enjoy the Mothman as a fantastical creature. Mothman tourism has become an economic staple in the small town of Point Plesant, drawing crowds of people to come to the annual Mothman Festival, to view the statue that the community built for the Mothman, and to wander the woods around the WWII munitions plant, hunting for the illusive creature itself. Throughout the years Mothman has been in the public's eye, it hasn't been a source of controversy or wide scrutiny, and most Mothman hunters go to Point Plesant and come back with a great experience and a few scrapes and bruises from their time in the woods, as no hunters have died while looking for this specific crypid unlike the countless other cryptids that have blood on their names, and potentially their hands. Its overall contribution to the cryptozoology field has also allowed many people to start enjoying the realm of the thought to be imposible, adding Mothman to the roster of other cryptids known world over like Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti, El Chupacabra, and Nessie. There is certainly no harm in allowing the general public to enjoy and celebrate <strong>the Man, The Myth, The Moth</strong>.
