  <h3><a href="https://cayla-wills.github.io/IASC1P02/Lab%202/Challenge2Site1.html">A Brief Overview of Mothman</a></h3>
  <p>The story and lore surrounding the <em>Mothman</em> is an excellent example of modern American folklore. Getting its start in the late 1960s in <strong>Point Plesant West Virginia</strong>, Mothman has captivated audiences around the world with its unique stories, sightings, and suspicious origin. While many people have their speculations about the creature, most fall into one of three camps when talking about the reason this creature exists. These camps are:</p>

      <li><a href="#AnAlien">An Alien Life Form Connected to the Men In Black</a></li>
      <li><a href="#AHoax">A Hoax or Mass Hysteria</a></li>
    </ol>
  <p>Most surprisingly, the Mothman actually has no real connections to actual moths. Its original description likens it more to a "<em>large flying man with 10-foot wings</em>", or a "<em>large grey creature</em>". The only mention in the description that is vaguely moth-like is the <strong><font color="red">red eyes</font></strong>, as some insects (like spiders and moths) have light reflecting eyes that could, under the right conditions, look like they are glowing red. Most scientist compare the mothman's wings to that of a sandhill crane, or other crane like birds, saying that what the two young couples saw that night at the WWII munitions plant was actually a migratory sandhill crane and not a creature beyond what we reason to be normal. Use the link below to compare the differences in images of moth and crane wings to understand the debate between the parapsychologists on the side of more supernatural phenomena, and the biologists/skeptics on the side of tangible science. <a href="mypage.html">Click Here for Moth v Crane Comparisons</a></p>
  <p>Mothman seems to be, according to most of the lore surrounding it, a benevolent creature that has become a staple in modern American folklore, and its reach is outstanding for such a small and quiet town in the 1960s. Like the other American cryptids, it draws in a crowd of fervent believers, casual enjoyers, and nicer non-believers/skeptics who just enjoy the Mothman as a fantastical creature. Mothman tourism has become an economic staple in the small town of Point Plesant, drawing crowds of people to come to the annual Mothman Festival, to view the statue that the community built for the Mothman, and to wander the woods around the WWII munitions plant, hunting for the illusive creature itself. Throughout the years Mothman has been in the public's eye, it hasn't been a source of controversy or wide scrutiny, and most Mothman hunters go to Point Plesant and come back with a great experience and a few scrapes and bruises from their time in the woods, as no hunters have died while looking for this specific crypid unlike the countless other cryptids that have blood on their names, and potentially their hands. Its overall contribution to the cryptozoology field has also allowed many people to start enjoying the realm of the thought to be imposible, adding Mothman to the roster of other cryptids known world over like Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti, El Chupacabra, and Nessie. There is certainly no harm in allowing the general public to enjoy and celebrate <em>the Man, The Myth, The Moth</em>.

  <h2><a id="AHarbinger"></a>A Harbinger of Cataclysmic Events</h2>
    <img src="mothman.png" alt="Mothman the Prophet playing card" width="179" height="224">
    <p> The most well known incident involving the Mothman is the Silver Bridge collapse on December 15th 1967. During rush hour traffic the 39 year old steel eyebar-chain suspension bridge collapsed throwing people and their cars into the cold Ohio river below. 64 people entered the water below and 46 people never came out of the river alive thanks to a small crack, poor managment, and carrying loads much too heavy for the bridge to support. This disaster lead to the renewal of bridge saftey guidelines and the reconstruction of many similar bridges across North and South America. You are probably wondering "Well what does the Mothman have to do with this?" and thats where it gets its title as the Harbinger of Cataclysmic Events. It all started in November 1967 with the two couples who first saw the Mothman, and during the month leading up to the Silver Bridge collapse in December of the same year, people continued to see the creature known as the Mothman, as well as other supernatural events including (but not limited to):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strange lights seen circling the Point Plesant area</li>
        <li>TV and Radio sets acting up</li>
        <li>A notable static humming or buzzing in the air</li>
        <li>Animals barking at seemingly nothing</li>
        <li>Strange men in black overcoats roaming the streets</li>
      </ul>
    <p>The locals that believed in the Mothman said that it was trying to warn them about the bridge collapsing, and after the bridge did collaspe, the Mothman just vanished and the supernatural events plaguing Point Plesant came to a grinding hault. However, this isn't the only time Mothman, or a Mothman like creature has been seen before and during a cataclysmic event. On April 26 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near the city of Pripyat in Ukrane had a meltdown at the maximum level of severity on the International Nuclear Event scale. To this day only two events rank at Major Accident, Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi, which resulted in exclusion zones up to 30km or 19mi around each site where no one could live, work, or visit with out proper clearance or equipment. Before the disaster at Chernobyl several workers at the Nuclear Plant and regular civilians claimed to have seen "a large black bird creature with glowing red eyes", even being spotted at the site of the plant's control room. Those who saw the "Black Bird of Chernobyl" were plagued with horrible nightmares and threating phone calls all leading up to the disaster. Those working to evacuate the towns and villages surrounding Chernobyl after the inital warning claimed to have seen the Black Bird flying above or towards the plant, sending a message of doom and catastropy to anyone who saw it. Many people belive that this "Black Bird of Chernobyl" is actually Point Plesant's own Mothman, who went to warn the people of Chernobyl about the cataclysmic event that would soon follow.</p>

  <h2><a id="AnAlien"></a>An Alien Life Form Connected to the Men In Black</h2>
    <p>Its seems like whenever a event happens that we can't rationally or logically explain happens, the <strong>Men in Black</strong> are always there to clean up the mess that is left behind. Men in Black or MIB are most commonly seen/encountered after sightings of UFOs or abductions where UFOs are involved. Within the field of UFOs and UFOlogy, many people believe that the MIB are sent to harrass, threaten, or even assassinate those who have witnessed a UFO/UFOs, study UFOs, or have been abducted by UFOs. Some people believe the the MIBs are part of the goverment, similar to the NSA, CIA, or FBI, and are tasked with keeping UFOs and aliens a secret from the general public, while others believe that the MIBs are aliens themselves and are trying to prevent the secret of other sentient life a secret from the human population as a whole. Some folklorists and psychologists believe that the MIB could just be some peoples' completely normal reaction to forms of psychological trauma, similar to how some people believe that they have seen or spoken to lucifer.</p>
    <p>Considering one of the supernatural events that occurred around one of the most well known "Mothman" events was sightings of strange men in black overcoats, many believe that Mothman could actually be an alien that is associated with the MIBs. Though this connection is fairly loose at best, as no one can firmly place Mothman at any known UFO sightings outside the very sparse strange lights seen around the Point Plesant area during the time of peak Mothman sightings. This is not to say that Mothman is 100% not an alien, as all theories have their own validity or sprinkle of truth somewhere in there. Though perhaps the title of alien is more suited for a different West Virginian cryptid, the Flatwoods Monster.</p>

  <h2><a id="AHoax"></a>A Hoax or Mass Hysteria</h2>
    <p>This section should be pretty self explainatory as when people talk about hoaxes or mass hysteria, stories of cryptids, aliens, ghosts and monsters often rise to the surface. For most humans, its rational to be scared and have your mind jump to a conclusion that doesn't quite make sense right off the bat. Our brains are trying to figure out whether we should fight or flee and wires can get crossed in the background telling us that we saw something, when we really didn't. Thats where the theories about native birds or strange clouds or even low flying planes come into play. After our brains calm down and can look at the situation clearer, not under the stress of so much adrenaline, we can start to piece together exactly what we saw and cut out any unrealistic things our brain might have come up with.</p>
    <p>On the topic of Hoaxes, many people believe that those who tell such fantastical stories are just telling them for their 15 minutes of fame, trying to have their turn in the limelight. Which is true in some cases like the Hoax of Balloon Boy, or the Hurricane Harvey Freeway Shark, these cases are great examples of people trying be famous for even a fraction of a second, and if the couples in 1967 truly told this story to be famous in their local community, then my hats off to them. They created a creature so wonderful, so captivating that it remains as a staple in modern American folklore to this day 55 years later. <u><em>Now that is good story telling!</em></u>

  <h2>Mothman in Modern Media</h2>
