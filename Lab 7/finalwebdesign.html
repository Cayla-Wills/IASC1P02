          <h1>What is a Brathaus or Biergarten?</h1>
          <h2>Brathaus</h2>
          <p>A Brathaus is a type of restaurant where traditional German and Baravian foods are usually served alongside beer and other spirits and liquors. Bratwurst is the name sake of these establishments, as the most common form of pub food served there. Bratwurst is a type of German sausage that contains pork, beef, or veal with spices. The name is German, derived from Old High German as in “brat” meaning frying and “wurst” referring to sausage. There are several types of bratwurst sausages available. Although, most North Americans refer to a bratwurst as a specific kind of sausage. In Germany and throughout Europe, the bratwurst just means the style of preparation.</p>
          <h2>Biergarten</h2>
          <p>Biergartens are a place to drink beer communally at tables outside a brewery, and they are officially a central part of Bavarian culture. What sets them apart from German Biergartens is that you may bring your own food into a Bavarian Biergarten. Biergartens became a social gathering place for Bavarians, and it became quite common to bring sausage and cheese to supplement the beer and bread already served there. Even though many Biergartens do sell wurst, stecklerfish, obatdza, and kartoffelsalat, it's not unusal for people to bring their favourite picnic foods from home to enjoy in the shade with others. Some people go all out, bringing tablecloths, and cultery as well as some amazing foods!</p>
