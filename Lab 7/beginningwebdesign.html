    <h2>Starting Notes</h2>
    <img class="imageOne" src="notesforwebsite.jpg" alt="The notes that I made when re-desiging the website">
    <p>Starting off, that website was horrible, it burned my eyes to just look at it. After questioning what thoughts went on when creating that hellsite, I started with the colour scheme I wanted to use, I decided on split complimentary using different shades of blue, yellow-oranges, and red-oranges. Keeping the light blue from the original logo was important to create cohesion while "refreshing" the design for the logo and the brathaus design used on the website.</p>
    <h2>Logo</h2>
    <img class="imageTwo" src="brathaus.png" alt="New Logo"></img>
    <p>I re-designed both of these because the original designs were much too busy, and drew attention away from the main purpose of the site. By taking away the hard to read text on the logo, as well as removing the excess checkerboard pattern from the banner, I made the logo much more appealing to look at. Considering that this Brathaus also acts as a Beirgarten, I figured that adding the cheersing beer steins would be a good idea to take away from the checkerboard pattern, making it less distracting. Finally, I changed the colour scheme from the light blue and red to a more subtle blue and orange colour scheme.</p>
    <h2>Beirgarten</h2>
    <img class="imageOne" src="beirgarten.png" alt="New Brathaus"></img>
    <p>The original design for the Brathaus image on the website had so much going on, it was hard to understand exactly what the view was supposed to be focusing on, let alone what was important for the content of the website. After parsing through it, I managed to grab a few things from it that I decided to add to the navigation tabs, while the rest I assumed was just fan fare for the Brathaus's german vibe. In the end I still wanted to use a version of the Brathaus image in the final site, so I came up with a simple design that fit with the colour scheme I chose, as well as aligned with traditional german architecture to capture that vibe. The last detail added was the german flag, as the original site had a few german flags scattered around it, and while the idea of germany was still present in the site, I still wanted to include at least one german flag, to really drive the point home.</p>
    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>As for the organization of the site as a whole, most of what was included on the site could have been put into a navigation bar and sorted based on standard restaurant website fare. The menus can be sorted into one drop down navigation tab, the live music can live on its own page that can be updated when new bands or musicians come, reviews can be stored under another drop down navigation tab sorted by year, grilling instructions on another stand alone site, and finally a drop down tab for contacting them (including things like phone number, address, social medias, and hours/reservations)</p>
    <h2>Oktoberfest</h2>
    <img class="imageTwo" src="oktoberfestbanner.png" alt="Oktoberfest Banner"></img>
    <p>Finally I added an Oktoberfest Banner image to be used as a clickable link to buy tickets for the Oktoberfest 2012 celebration. Felt like an okay way to add that little nugget of information on the site. This section can be taken out after Oktoberfest, or rerouted to a new site that shows images and videos of the last Oktoberfest celebration.</p>
