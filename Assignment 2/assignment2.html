      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p>In the 1730s, the area of Frederick County Maryland USA started to be settled by german immigrants who along with their families, businesses, and farms, they also brought over their colourful and terrifying folklore. Among the folk creatures brought over was the Schenller Geist which is a german boogyman type figure whose name translates to "quick spirit". Like most other boogyman-like figures, most chocked up the Schenller Geist to a creature imagined up by mothers to scare their children into being good, though there are those that believe this creature truly did and does exist. Over the years, as those german immigrants slowly became more americanized, the name of this creature started to change from the very german Schenller Geist, to the more americanized Snallygaster which was easier for the general population to pronounce.
      <h3>Apperance</h3>
      <p>The apperance of the Snallygaster varies between reports, some likening it to a flying serpent, others to a horrific scaled bird, and some even believe it is a dragon! In the earliest folk lore, the Snallygaster's appearance is similar to other spirits and ghouls from germany, taking the nightmarish qualities of those specters, and mixing it with traits found most commonly in birds, like wings, a beak, and long deadly talons. Other descriptions from more modern day sources claim that the Snallygaster has the following appearance.</p>
        <div class="quotes">
          <p>"The beast is half-reptile, half-bird with a metallic-like beak lined with razor-sharp teeth. Sometimes people would claim they could see octopus like tentacles coming from the mouth of the beast, while others say that the monster sucked the blood of its victims"</p>

      <h3>Snally in the News</h3>
      <p>For many years, no one had a true sighting of the Snallygaster, as the story lived on in the communities of german-american families who continued to live in the area. Or that was the case until 1909 when sightings of the beast started to appear in the newspaper. Throughout February and March of 1909 local residents of Frederick County described:</p>
        <div class="quotes">
        <p>"It was a creature with enormous wings, a long pointed bill, claws like steel hooks, and a single eye in the center of its forhead. It screamed like a loud locomotive whistle."</p>
        </div>
      <p>The encounters with the beast continued to spread and one article in February 1909 claimed that a witness saw the Snallygaster seize a man, carry it off into the air, drain the body of blood, and drop the man on a nearby hillside, though no reports of an exsanguinated corpse preceeded or followed this article. Eventually stories spread throughout Maryland, and eventually even the current US president, Theodore Roosevelt (an avid big game hunter), considered postponing an African safari to personally hunt the beast while the Smithsonian offered a reward for the hide of the creature.</p>
    <h3>How to Repel the Snallygaster</h3>
    <p>Though not much is fully known about the Snallygaster and how to repel it, there are at least two known ways to stop the beast from coming close enough to attack. They are as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>Placing a seven-pointed star on a building (most commonly found on barns)</li>
        <li>Calling out the name of the Dewayo, the Snallygaster's natural enemy</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>What is the Dewayo?</h3>
    <p>The Dewayo is another local cryptid to Frederick County Maryland, and the alleged enemy of the Snallygaster. It's a Dogman type cryptid taking on the form of a wolf, standing upright like a man. While its natural enemy is the Snallygaster, it has also reportedly attacked many humans. Encounters with the Dewayo include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>John Becker, 1965, first reported attackee. Described the creature as "Big as a bear, but looked more like a wolf, it stood on its hind legs and attacked me".</li>
      <li>Jim A, 1966, not attacked but the creature warned him not to get closer. Described the creature as "Dark brown and shaggy, stood on two legs and was about the size of a deer. It walked real funny, almost spider-like".</li>
      <li>Two Unnamed men, 1976, ran across the road in front of their car. Described the creature as "Wolf-like creature with dark fur, ran on two legs".</li>
      <li>Two Unnamed Park Rangers, 1978, saw the creature on patrol of state park. Described the creature as "Large hairy creature running on two legs".</li>
    </ul>

      <p><a name="Pageend"></a><center>In the end, is the Snallygaster real?</center></p>
      <p>We may never know! That's the fun thing about cryptids, they could be real, but the fun of it all is just believing the stories told by people a long time ago. Like Micheal Scott, author of the Alchemyst once said, "At the heart of every legend there is a grain of truth", so perhaps at one point, something in the Snallygaster's story was very true. We may never know.</p>
