      <h3>The Opossum's Oddities</h3>
      <p>Pretty much anyone who has special interests has things that they collect, it’s common knowledge. Typically they end up being small things like rocks or bottle caps, simple things that don’t need much space in a room or storage. Some people squirrel them away from the light of day to hoard, while others display them proudly and openly encourage people to ask questions or take a closer look.I like to display my treasures, and not hoard them away from people like a big grumpy dragon would.</p>
      <p>It started with a very small shelf in my childhood room that contained my most valuable treasures, like my tooth jar, my great grandmother’s porcelain bell, a jewelry box that my mother used when she was a girl, my Disney pin collection, etc. However after a renovation in my room, the trinket shelf had to go, and I could no longer display my trinkets with pride, until I moved into my third house in university. The previous residents left a piece of trim that acted like a shelf on the longest wall in my room, and I decided to keep it, and use it to display all my new trinkets, like souvenirs I buy or pick up in my travels, stones I found interesting, trinkets my friends gave me, and art projects I’ve completed.</p>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Glass Bottles</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>I cannot express how happy glass bottle make me. Like I see a fun shaped glass bottle and I HAVE to get it, whether its a wine bottle, old medicine bottles, yogurt containers, anything that is made of glass and can store something, I want it. They make me feel like a little cottage core witch with all my potion ingredients in cute glass jars just waiting to be used in a fun little spell to bring good harvests to the land around me.</p>

        </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Rocks and Gems</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Like the glass bottles, rocks and gems bring me the same serotonin and I cannot explain why. My mom brought me to a rock farm (yes those exist) and I had the best time of my life! We spent hours there in the rock pit cracking open rocks and finding gems and minerals to take home for my trinket shelf in my room. I got 2 pounds worth of rocks for 6 dollars and I love those things! I also make it a habit of picking up a small rock or stone from anywhere I visit. Though national parks are a little more iffy on the rules of take only photos leave only memories, so I respect those rules and don’t take anything from them. I did go over to Italy for an archeological study and I did end up taking refuse rocks (the rocks dug out of the sites) with me, as I was very excited to be there and take a small piece back with me with the approval of my professors who were archeologists who had worked at the sites.</p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Beach Treasures</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Nothing beats combing the beach for lost treasures, though the treasures I’m looking for aren’t the usually silver and gold hidden by pirates, its random things deposited by the surf into the sand. Things like sea glass, bones, shells, the occasional coin, smoothed rocks, and much more. Those little trinkets are fun to find, and fun to display in, you guessed it, glass bottles! I feel like they tell a little story, and maybe carry a little luck along with them.</p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pins and Buttons</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>I love collecting pins and buttons to put on jackets, bags, and cork boards. They feel so special to me and my students love to see what buttons and pins are on my bag as I switch them out often. They also allow me to express all my special interests in a more subtle way than just info dumping it onto my students. I want to make my own buttons and pins eventually, and sell them online to fund projects for my students, or donate to charities. They bring a sense of child like joy to me, and remind me of the first buttons I got at comic con when I was 13.</p>
