      <h3>My Brain's Not Dumb, Just Wired Different</h3>
      <p>I have an issue, that issue is with my brain. I can’t focus very well on things that other people want me to do, and that stresses me out to no end. It was hard as a younger student as my teachers would just assume I’m lazy, or just didn’t want to do my work. I did want to do my work, I wasn’t trying to be lazy, I just couldn’t motivate myself to any of my work. I felt ashamed because none of my peers ever felt the same. It wasn’t until I was in university that I realized that I could motivate myself to do work if I included things that I liked, if I included my special interests I could function normally. So I started to twist and turn assignments into something I could do with my special interests, while still meeting the expectations.</p>
      <p id="thePara">So this is my final project for this course, all about my special interests.</p>
