      <h3>The Crow's Corner</h3>
      <p>Everyone loves a specific game or TV show but I can never like things in a cool way. I get way too obsessed to the point where it becomes part of my very being. “Hey you know _________, their like the [game/show] GUY. They know everything about it!” type obsessed.</p>
      <p>I do lose interest now in things now and again, its not uncommon to change or abandon special interests. As I’ve grown up and matured I’ve chosen different things to be special interests that younger me would have hated! There are a few things that have stayed with me since I was a child, but those are few and far between.</p>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pokémon</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>This is one of the few special interests that I have had since I was child. It’s my oldest and most consistent special interests, and it started with Pokémon cards in elementary school, and was solidified by 2011 when my grandma got my brother and I copies of Black and White, the newest game at the time. I brought my DS everywhere so I could play Pokémon on the go, and even though I was obsessed with that game (and continue to play it even now) I never managed to finish that game! The Elite Four (the lead up to the Champion) were always too hard and I never brought enough potions and revives to survive the onslaught.</p>
          <p>Black and White was the only game I really got to play outside online emulators of the older gameboy games, until 2021 when I decided to buy a Nintendo Switch. Shortly after I got the switch, Legends Arceus came out and I could live my Pokémon dreams again! It was so much fun to play it again, and to see so many Pokémon I had never really caught before! Then this year (2022), the newest title in the Pokémon saga, Scarlet and Violet, came out for the switch and I was back on the Pokémon hype train. This would mark the first mainstream Pokémon game where I have completed the main story. It made me feel like a little kid again, opening up Pokémon on Christmas and playing it religiously. The characters, the Pokémon, the open world, everything made me feel so happy! Arven and Penny (two rivals/friends you make in the game) really stood out to me and became my favourite characters, and I’d kill for Penny’s fluffy Eevee bag.</p>

        </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Genshin Impact</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>At the height of the pandemic I got really sick, and was basically bed ridden for a few months which is the most boring existence known to man. All of my other games, shows, special interests were just not fun anymore when I couldn’t sprawl out and play them where I pleased, and I was just tired of being bored. That was until I saw a YouTube ad showcasing a brand new free to play mobile game that was very similar to Breath of the Wild, a large scale open world RP game that I had wanted to play since it’s release in 2017. I figured why not, its free and if it sucks I can just delete it and try something else.</p>
          <p>2 years later, it’s still on my tablet and I’m eagerly awaiting a switch release. I love this game, not only because its an OWRPG (open world role playing game) but the story telling is beautiful and the characters are stunning. Every time we get a new story update I am always jumping on the new quests and map locations and exploring them to completion. My favourite thing about the game is that each country, or region, is based on a real life culture, so through events and the story I learn a little more about that culture! The character I play most is Zhongli, the retired god of Liyue, as he has a great shield that can absorb so much damage, though my favourite characters are Venti (the god of Mondstadt), Itto (a sweet but very dumb oni from Inazuma) and The Wanderer (a 500+ year old puppet with murderous intent).</p>

        </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Criminal Minds</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Another long term special interest! I love the science behind true crime and the characters are so real and compelling, it makes me want to root for them all the time! I have been obsessed with true crime since I was a teen, the stories of serial killers like H. H. Holmes and Jack the Ripper always held special places in my heart, as the psychology and mystery surrounding the cases intrigued me enough to do my own research. After a few seasons of a different true crime show on YouTube, I figured out that criminal minds was on Disney plus and I binged most of the early seasons.</p>
        <p>I found special interest in one of the main characters who I saw bits of myself in, that character is boy genius, socially inept, “it’s doctor, not agent”, SSA Dr Spencer Reid. He is such a charming and lovable character and his character arcs are so sad, you can’t help but love him. I wish that my parents would say that I’m like him, rather than telling everyone that I’m just like Sheldon from the Big Bang, Sheldon’s social ineptitude and academic prowess is annoying and overplayed, while Dr Reid’s is more natural and played out seamlessly. His coworkers never make him feel bad, and several times they encourage him to break out of his shell and get better with social interactions. Without him a large majority of the cases on Criminal Minds would never be solved.</p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Demon Slayer</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The newest of my special interests, and ho boy is this one a doozy. I have loved anime and cartoons since I was a little kid, and my interests would always change with the release of new anime/manga, but when I saw Demon Slayer, I knew it was going to be more than a passing watch. I fell in love with the main characters, Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko, as well as the rest of their little traveling squad (Zenitsu and Inosuke). The anime/manga are dark and sad, but there are goofs and funny moments in the story to help lighten the mood.</p>
        <p>My favourite character out of everyone is Rengoku Kyojirou, the flame hashira/pillar. He’s a bright and positive man with flaming hair who loves his brother and sweet potatoes more than anything in the world. He takes the main squad under his wing and tries to teach them how to be good demon slayers. Even when he has to be negative or intimidating he does it with a smile and strong happy voice. The funniest of his quirks is the fact that anytime he eats anything that tastes good he shouts “UMAI” which translates to "DELICIOUS" or “TASTY” in the English dub, and that just cracks me up every time. His story is very sad, and he dies very early into both the anime and manga, but he is still my favourite one.</p>
